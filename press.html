    <h2>Il Sorpasso</h2>
    <p>"What may be the greatest road movie comes not from America but from the tiny, 
    long-settled Italy of 1962...and one that's influenced Hollywood pictures as different
    as Easy Rider and Sideways... the Criterion Collection's superb new Blu-ray and DVD package
    that's flush with extras, including a smart, filmed introduction by Sideways' Alexander Payne.
    Enormously entertaining and sneakily deep, Il Sorpasso feels as vibrant today as it did in the
    '60s." - John Powers, NPR</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>"I think that it is one of the year's most important releases and I am convinced that come
    December it will appear on many prestigious Top 10 lists. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED." - bluray.com</p>

    <h2>John Cassavetes: 5 Films</h2>
    <p>"In the quarter-century since his death at 59, Cassavetes' uncategorizable work has lost none
    of its breathtaking intensity...Criterion Collection's recent release on Blu-ray of its 2004 DVD
    set "John Cassavetes: Five Films" provides an opportunity to revisit some of his groundbreaking
    work in all its digitally restored vérité glory." - Sheri Linden, LA TIMES</p>

    <h2>The Long Day Closes</h2>
    <p>"That is what makes The Long Day Closes one of the great films about memory: It
    actually mimics the way we process the past—the way certain sights, sounds, and events
    remain vivid in our minds, even as everything around them fades into oblivion." - A.V. Club (The Onion)</p>

    <h2>Insomnia</h2>
    <p>"Criterion's upcoming Blu-ray release of Norwegian director Erik Skjoldbjærg's fantastic neo-noir thriller Insomnia -- which deserves a lot of credit for the popularization of the Nordic Noir genre -- is a stunner. Recently restored in 4K, the film looks simply spectacular in high-definition. In fact, I have to say that this is the best looking Blu-ray release I have seen from Criterion this year. Don't miss it, folks. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED." - bluray.com</p>

    <h2>Lord of the Flies</h2>
    <p>"My point is that Lord of the Flies is not “just” some classic to be revered, but one which even speaks to our IMAX 3D-inundated Millenials. I think it speaks volumes to just how good the movie is, and this Criterion Collection edition is definitive. See it now, before your kid does and shows you up." - cinemasentries.com</p>
